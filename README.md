# [Merge Immersive](http://www.mergeimmersive.com/)

## Created by "The A-Team": Dominique Hosea, Jack Lambert, Johnathan Blackburn

### August 2020

Students of our GA Cohort need a more direct way to communicate with each other, and reveal each others portfolios.

The project idea came about by a similar topic and concept from Dominique's project 2, "Career Connect".

Merge Immersive operates in a similar fashion to most social media websites but on a smaller scale. On the home page, you will see students profiles on cards, and their profile informaton upon clicking them. Within profiles, you can see a link to their github portfolio.

## Getting Started

To get started with this website, use the SIGN UP link to bring to the sign up page. This site is designed with GA students in mind. On the Sign Up page you will be prompted for an email address and name, and other information about your cohort.

In the top right corner is a dropdown menu where a user can edit their profile information.
Users can see each others profiles on a feed, which displays information they may have deemed willing to share with other classmates. For example, github projects, linked in information, their location, hobbies, etc.

## Unsolved Problems

Creating a progress bar with the correct calculated number was not solved, as we were unable to return the correct.
The Edit form page lead to many problems upon figuring out the best way to be interactive.
Including the projects github data into a User's profile has been attempeted but yet to be solved.
Light and Dark mode button was attempted but unsolved.

## Future Enhancements

- Main issue we could not face was including a LinkedIn API request, in order to show job data, this would be a useful feature.
- Including a vetting process to make sure users are associated with GA
- a profile strength progress bar
- Users can comment or like on other people's features
